Algorithm analysis is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps us evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. By understanding how an algorithm performs in terms of time and space complexity, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a given problem.

## Time Complexity

Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Common time complexities include:

- **O(1)**: Constant time, the fastest possible.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time, efficient for large inputs.
- **O(n)**: Linear time, scales directly with input size.
- **O(nÂ²)**: Quadratic time, often seen in nested loops.

## Space Complexity

Space complexity evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm uses. Efficient algorithms minimize memory usage while maintaining performance.

## Practical Example

Consider searching for an element in a sorted array. Using a linear search has a time complexity of **O(n)**, while binary search reduces it to **O(log n)** by dividing the search space in half at each step.

```python
print("hello world")
```

## Conclusion

Understanding algorithm analysis allows developers to write efficient code, optimize performance, and solve problems effectively. By mastering these concepts, you can make better design choices and improve the scalability of your applications.
